emacs-sas
=========

These are emacs files for SAS code.

There are actually quite a few emacs add-ons for emacs already. Several of the emacs tools I wrote over the years
won't do anyone but an internal SAS developer any good.

There is one that is useful.  tpl-mode.  This gives syntax highlighting and indention to ODS Tagset programs.

Put it in your emacs folder and load it up.
